I had same problem, the process must keep alive but the socket must close. Closing a socket in a running process is not impossible but difficult:

    locate the process :

    netstat -np

    You get a source/destination ip:port portstate pid/processname map

    locate the the socket's file descriptor in the process

    lsof -np $pid

    You get a list: process name, pid, user,fileDescriptor, ... a connection string.

    Locate the matching fileDescriptor number for the connection.

    Now connect the process:

    gdb -p $pid

    Now close the socket:

    call close($fileDescritor)

    //does not need ; at end.

    Then detach:

    quit

    And the socket is closed.
